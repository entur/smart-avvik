This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`kix-avvik` is an experiment from Entur's Team KI-eksperimentering aimed at proactive disruption handling (Norwegian: "proaktiv avvikshåndtering"). It predicts the duration of public-transport disruptions from SIRI-SX situation messages using BigQuery ML.

## Tooling

- Use uv for Python operations
- Use bq for bigquery operations. For instance, use bq show --schema --format=prettyjson ent-anshar-prd:realtime.siri_realtime_et_production

## Important BigQuery tables

- ent-anshar-prd:realtime.siri_realtime_sx_production: SIRI Estimated Timetable, real-time updates to the planned timetable
- ent-anshar-prd:realtime.siri_realtime_et_production: Situation Exchange, textual incident and disruption messages

## Conventions

- All SQL targets BigQuery Standard SQL; legacy SQL is not used.
- Text fields are filtered to Norwegian (`language IS NULL OR UPPER(language) = 'NO'`) — preserve this when adding queries against SX data.
- The two-year partition window (`_PARTITIONTIME >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR)`) is the standard lookback for training queries.
